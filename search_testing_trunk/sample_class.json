            "text": "OK, first things first:\r\n\r\n(1) You ABSOLUTELY MUST have strong C (not C++) coding skills to even consider taking this class!  Either CS107 or CS110 (or both) is recommended.  If you do not, you willbe in for a world of hurt,to quote the legendary Mehran Sahami.  The programming assignments, while not incredibly difficult, do require a significant amount of C coding, and you will be doing a lot of debugging with gdb, valgrind, and network analyzer tools like Wireshark.\r\n\r\n(2) I would also recommend taking CS161 before this class, as some of the material on routing (e.g. Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra) will make more sense if you have a good background in graph traversal algorithms.\r\n\r\n(3)  Last of all, this class has a heavy workload -- sometimes cruelly so.  There are many types of work (8 weeks of video lectures/quizzes, 4 programming assignments, 2 written homeworks, and 2 exams) and theyre often packed together with similar due dates. In addition, the teaching staff is fond of sadistic exercises like holding (mandatory) class the day of the midterm (why?? is this really necessary??).  Oh, and the exams are VERY difficult.\r\n\r\nThat all being said: CS144 is a valuable course, and youll learn lots of the intricate -- but fundamental -- details of what makes the Internet work: Ethernet, TCP/IP, routing, physical/link layer (what is WiFi? how does the router in your closet work? how do packets flow between different hosts?) and of course security. It forces you to examine and think critically about key Internet protocols that we use every day, and often take for granted.  The course staff were also extremely helpful and responsive on Piazza. I found McKeowns teaching style to be much more clear and understandable than Levis, but your mileage may vary.",

            "text": "This class is a LOT of work, and you will learn a LOT about networking and the internet in this class.\r\n\r\nAs of Autumn 2013, Phil Levis and Nick McKeown teach this class viaflipped classroom. This unfortunately results in much more work than a normal lecture style class. Every week you are required to watch 10-12 videos (ranging from 15-30 minutes long), and every video has a short 3-5 question quiz on its material. The quiz is supposed to check that you watched the video, but in reality the quiz questions are as difficult as exam questions. You need to have a mastery of the material in order to answer them correctly. Some questions require you to lookup (google or RFC) information not covered in the video. You only get 2 attempts at each question, and overall the quizzes account for 10% of your grade. This was incredibly frustrating for me, and was by far my biggest complaint about the class. Videos + quizzes alone took me about 8-10 hours per week.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 labs (coding projects) and 2 homeworks. Labs 1 and 4 were the biggest; they each took me about 25-30 hours to complete. Labs 2 and 3 took me around 15 hours. The homeworks took about 10 hours each.\r\n\r\nAnd best of all, even though it's flipped classroom, lecture is not optional! We were required to attend 16 of the 20 lectures in the quarter.\r\n\r\nDespite all these complaints, there were a lot of positives. Phil and Nick are very smart and very knowledgeable. Lecture was almost always useful, and most of the videos are very informative. The labs do a good job of reinforcing the material, and the homeworks are good review for the midterm/final. Speaking of exams, the midterm and final are not easy - I would recommend studying and fully understanding the homeworks and online quizzes.\r\n\r\nSo all in all, this class took up most of my time the quarter I took it. I wish they were more upfront about the time requirement, but at the end of the class you will have a very deep understanding of the internet, from how ethernet and wi-fi work to how IP packets are routed, to how TCP gives us reliable data transfer, and more. And that's pretty cool.",

            "text": "I found this class a bit painful. When all was said and done, it was worth it, but it wasn't exactly pleasant.\r\n\r\nTo me, networking is interesting by virtue of its infrastructural component -- unlike most areas in computer science, you get to think on a bigger scale than what goes on inside your box. As in, the world big. \r\n\r\nI think all the coolest stuff comes at that level, including DNS and all the funky organizational structure that exists to support the Internet. Most of the class doesn't really deal with this, though...much more time is spent on the details of protocol operation. Which is, honestly, about as exciting as it sounds. Certainly, I now appreciate the power and difficulty of protocol engineering, but a few to many lectures were spent rolling through the details of protocols. Often, actually, lectures kind of devolved into long strings of protocol details with little in the way of broader significance.\r\n\r\nLevis is organized and intelligent. He prides himself on clarity of presentation, which he may or may not have really had -- again, after the 50th detail about TCP, clarity isn't as important as simply keeping the classes attention. Phil's approach is a bit too placid to hold most students for 75 minutes, so lectures could end up a little dry. From talking to students from previous years, I get the impression that Mazieres brought an impassioned attitude that might've made things more interesting, even if they were less clear. \r\n\r\nAssignments are pretty hard, often because there's a lot to do, there's unresolved ambiguity about what needs to be done, and the programs are difficult to debug. The whole get-it-from-the-RFC thing is cool, but its mixed with a sort of half-specification at the assignment or reference solution level that doesn't leave you the freedom the RFC intends to while not providing the clairty an assignment handout could. This is one of the most active classes on Piazza as a result. \r\n\r\nThe writing assignments were presented without any guidance, which was a problem because, actually, Levis wanted a VERY SPECIFIC THING, and graded based on how close the assignment fulfilled the criteria defining his ideal. His ideal was not unreasonable, but it was a pain that he didn't make it clear until far into the quarter. The writing assignments were valuable, but more guidance --  and a point to useful resources (and, maybe topics that were closer to actual class material) potentially could have been nice.\r\n\r\nThe TA's were very good, though there were some unfortunate big grading mistakes.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's empowering to know what all those funky acronyms mean, and the infrastructural picture is deep and interesting (thank you, Jon Peterson!). The class is worthwhile, but only if you're willing to wade through the pain even when the class is less interesting.\r\n\r\nGood luck, and bookmark Piazza.",

Lot of material is covered in the lectures but most of it is informational and not tested. True/False questions are asked and zero marks are awarded if you get correct answer but absolutely incorrect reasoning. One advice will be think of every topic taught in class and see if it can have something to solve the question if you have no clue. One question was related to cryptography, dns and nat i.e  its difficult to get clue to answer such questions. Prof Phil Levis is great. He introduced writing assignments this quarter.
